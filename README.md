# QuickRef
Requires Python 3.10

Highly specific Python software to create financial approval email messages based on MN skilled nursing facility (SNF) referral payer setups.

Runs in the terminal only.

This minimalistic software serves a very specific purpose.
When I financially review referrals to our SNF, nearly all referrals prompt a response from me that fits one of about 10 basic forms/templates.
This software accepts all needed user input to generate emails for me, and it copies that email text to the Windows clipboard.

Instead of writing each email from scratch, or selecting one of 10ish text templates and altering them for a specific referral (which might take more time than writing the email from scratch), I use this software to very quickly generate my email response.
