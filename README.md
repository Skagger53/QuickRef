# QuickRef
Highly specific software to create financial approval email messages based on MN skilled nursing facility (SNF) referral payer setups. Runs in the terminal only.

This minimalistic software serves a very specific purpose for a narrow application.
When I financially review referrals to our SNF, nearly all referrals prompt a response from me that fits one of about 10 basic forms/templates.
This software accepts all needed user input to generate my emails for me, and it copies that email text to the Windows clipboard.

Now instead of writing each email from scratch, or selecting one of 10ish text templates and altering them to be accurate for the specific referral (which might would take more time than writing the email from scratch), I use this software to very quickly generate my email response.
